The Open Mosque Project is about developing a website and web services for all mosques for near enough free. 
This is our open source and free static page. You will be able to set this webpage up for free for your mosque.
You only need a domain name. 

The idea is to keep this open source so that others can take and build on it. 
It would be great to grow an open community with ideas and know-how to help develop this for all mosques in the world.

We are still in early stages and needs people with the skills to help make this project a reality insha'Allah ðŸ¤².

### Other info
There are 2 great APIs to that we have used in projects to generate prayer times. Most mosques in London use https://www.londonprayertimes.com/api/. You may wish to consider that if you are from the UK.
For this project I have used the excellent https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api. No API Key needed.
